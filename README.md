## Optimizing Call Center Metrics at United Airlines | Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Python, and NLP


### Project Overview

#### Objective: 
Enhance customer service efficiency by reducing Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST) in United Airlines' call center operations.
####  Methods: 
Performed in-depth analysis of call center data to identify root causes of extended call durations and high wait times.
#### Tools: 
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NLP, and Machine Learning.

###Key Deliverables

#### AHT and AST Analysis: 
Analyzed factors contributing to high AHT and AST, identifying the most time-consuming and frequently occurring call reasons.
#### IVR System Optimization: 
Recommended improvements for the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system to enhance self-service options and reduce agent intervention.
#### Call Reason Categorization: 
Used NLP techniques to categorize call reasons, providing insights into recurring issues and guiding further optimization.


### Key Findings and Recommendations

#### High AHT and AST Drivers: 
Issues related to check-in and flight delays exhibited the longest handle times and highest wait times, indicating areas where efficiency improvements would have the most impact.
#### Self-Service Enhancements:
Recommended the implementation of self-service options for common inquiries (e.g., booking issues) to reduce agent workload and improve overall efficiency.
#### Agent Training Focus: 
Suggested targeted training for high AHT issues, allowing agents to resolve complex issues faster and reducing total handle time.

### Presentation and Resources

Project Presentation: Presentation Link
Data Analysis Scripts: Python scripts used for data analysis and visualization are included in the repository.

### Future Work

Further NLP analysis to automate call categorization based on call transcripts.
Integration of predictive models to anticipate call volumes and dynamically allocate resources.
Continued refinement of self-service options based on recurring call types and customer feedback.
